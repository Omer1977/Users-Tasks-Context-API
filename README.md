# Users & Tasks - Context API

In this simple project that I made as an example of centralized state management with the Context API, we see how to manage user and task data and how to transfer this data between components. Users are listed according to their names, surnames and e-mail addresses, detailed information about each user and their tasks can be viewed, and new tasks can be added and deleted.
